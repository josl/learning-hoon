I'm a programmer but I wouldn't say I'm a very good one. I don't have a computer science or math degree. I don't know much C or or low level systems programming. I just like to fiddle around with code and make things.

This is a series I began writing as I started to learn Urbit's programming language, Hoon. It started as more as a personal "Learning Hoon" journal than anything particularly useful. It was filled with questions, (wrong) assumptions and dead ends. As I started to understand more and more of the language though, I went back and edited out all those bits, and replaced them with explanations. At the time of this writing, there are no tutorials on Hoon. My only guide was the somewhat esoteric [official documentation](http://urbit.org/docs/), and help from the core team (and others) on `:talk` and reddit.

This tutorial is aimed at people who have experience with other programming language and are familiar with basic concepts like `variable`, `function`, `expression`, `objects`, etc. If you have corrections, questions, or suggestions, the entire book is available on [github](https://github.com/knubie/learning-hoon), so feel free to create an issue or pull request there.

Have fun!
